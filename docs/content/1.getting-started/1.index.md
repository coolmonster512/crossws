# Getting Started

CrossWS provides a cross-platform API to define well-typed WebSocket apps that can then be integrated into various WebSocket servers using built-in adapters.

Writing a realtime WebSocket server that can work in different javascript and WebSocket runtimes is challenging because there is no single standard for WebSocket servers. You often need to go into many details of diffrent API implementations and it also makes switching from one runtime costly. CrossWS is a solution to this!
