# WebSocket Client

Universal WebSocket API to connect to WebSocket servers from clients.

CrossWS exposes [`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) in order to connect to the server.

For all runtimes, except Node.js, native implementation is used, and for Node.js, a bundled version of [`ws.WebSocket`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) is bundled.

```js
import WebSocket from "crossws/websocket";
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using export conditions, the correct version will be always used so you don't have to worry about picking the right build!
