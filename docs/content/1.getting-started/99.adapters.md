# Runtime Adapters

CrossWS allows integrating your WebSocket hooks with different runtimes and platforms using built-in adapters. Each runtime has a specific method of integrating WebSocket. Once integrated, will work consistently even if you change the runtime.

See Adapters section to learn more about all available built-in adapters

## Integration with other runtimes

You can define your custom adapters using `defineWebSocketAdapter` wrapper.

See other adapter implementations in [`src/adapters`](https://github.com/unjs/crossws/tree/main/src/adapters/) to get an idea of how adapters can be implemented and feel free to directly make a Pull Request to support your environment in CrossWS!
