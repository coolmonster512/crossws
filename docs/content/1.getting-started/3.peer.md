# WebSocket Peer

Peer object allows easily interacting with connected clients.

Almost all Websocket hooks accept a peer instance as their first argument. You can use peer object to get information about each connected client or a message to them.

> [!TIP]
> You can safely log a peer instance to the console using `console.log` it will be automatically stringified with useful information including the remote address and connection status!
